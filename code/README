Datasets for Web Credibility Analysis
=====================================

Data collected from Snopes (www.snopes.com) and Wikipedia on February, 2016

1) Snopes dataset (Snopes_WWW2017.zip)
---------------------------------------

Each article on Snopes verifies a single claim. The Snopes editors 
assign a manual credibility verdict to each such claim: True or False. 
Few of the claims have labels like 'Mostly True' or 'Mostly False'. 
We map 'Mostly True' labels to 'True', and 'Mostly False' labels to 
'False' — thereby considering only binary credibility labels. 

Claims having labels like 'Partially True' or 'Partially False' are ignored.
The credibility verdict is accompanied by a description how the editor(s) 
came across the claim (e.g., it was collected from a Facebook post, or 
received by an email etc.), an 'Origins' section describing the origin of 
the claim, and an 'Description' section justifying the verdict. 

Total Claims: 4856
- True Claims: 1277
- False Claims: 3579

For each claim, we used the claim text as query to a web search engine and 
retrieved first three pages of the search results (~30 articles).


2) Wikipedia dataset (Wikipedia_WWW2017.zip)
---------------------------------------------

We collected a set of 100 proven hoaxes reported on the Wikipedia page: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List of hoaxes#Provenhoaxes
All these hoaxes can be mapped to claims of types: “<ENTITY> exists”, 
“<ENTITY> is genuine” or “<EVENT> occurred”. While collecting the
data, hoaxes not falling under these categories were ignored.
Words related to hoaxes, e.g., fake, fictional, nonexistent, etc., 
were removed from the claim description to avoid any kind of search bias
while retrieving articles using a search engine. Since the dataset contains
only hoaxes, the ground-truth label for all of these claims is Fake.

In addition, we also collected a set of 57 fictitious people 
as reported on the Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List of fictitious people
All these entities can be mapped to claims of type: “<ENTITY> exists”. 
The ground-truth label for all of these claims is Fake as 
the dataset contains only fictitious people.

For each claim, we used the claim text as query to a web search engine and 
retrieved first three pages of the search results (~30 articles).

JSON File Structure
=====================

Each claim (in Snopes and Wikipedia data) has a corresponding json file. 
The structure of the json file is as following:

{
"Claim_ID"				: A unique identifier of the claim 
"Claim"					: Textual claim which is being verified
"Credibility"			: true/false
"URL"					: URL of the corresponding snopes page
"Origins"				: Description of how the claim was originated. Corresponds to the "Origin" section in the Snopes article
"Example"				: Example of how Snopes spotted the claim. Corresponds to the "Example" section in the Snopes article
"Description"			: Description provided in the Snopes article about why the claim is true or false
"Originally Published"	: Date when the Snopes article was published
"Last Updated"			: Date when the Snopes article was last updated
"Referred Links"		: References used for verifying the claim. Corresponds to "Sources" section in the Snopes article
"Fact Check"			: Corresponds to the "Fact Check" section in some of the old Snopes articles
"Tags"					: Set of tags provided on the Snope article (seperated by semicolon)
"Google Results": A JSON Array containing web search results on first three pages of the results. 
[
	{
	results": [
        {
          "domain": "",
          "link": "",
          "link_type": ""
        },
		....
		{
          "domain": "",
          "link": "",
          "link_type": ""
        }
		]
	},
	....
	results": [
        {
          "domain": "",
          "link": "",
          "link_type": ""
        },
		....
		{
          "domain": "",
          "link": "",
          "link_type": ""
        }
		]
	}
]
}

For the claims from Wikipedia only "Claim", "Credibility", "Claim_ID" and "Google Results" fields are populated. 
Rest of the other fields are empty as they are specific to the Snopes dataset.
